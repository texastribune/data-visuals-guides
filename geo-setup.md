## QGIS

QGIS is a free, open-source alternative to ArcQGIS. It's very easy to [download on your computer](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).

Once set up, check out [these videos](https://journalismcourses.org/course/mappingandgis/) for an intro to using the program. They are taught by the Tribune's own Darla and Chris!
