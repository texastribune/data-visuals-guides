## Pre-setup

### Make sure you're the admin

Everything we do here is only going to work if you have admin privileges. How do you know if you have it?

1. Open your `System Preferences`.
2. Click on `Users & Groups`.
3. Do you see your name with `Admin` written below it on the left? Awesome! You're the admin.

![Are you the admin?](http://i.imgur.com/rTsdp5C.png?1)

Don't have admin powers? Reach out to the team and we'll help get you set up.

### Check for MacOS updates

If your computer is brand new, you may have a few outstanding operating system updates. Make sure to grab those first. [Use this guide to update](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201541).

### You and your terminal

The terminal is going to be your BFF, so it might as well not look terrible.

Open `Terminal`. It can be found in your `Applications` folder, or, search for it with `Spotlight` – it's the cute little magnifying glass at the top right of your screen next to your name. Type `Terminal` and it should come right up!

Currently it's just a white box with black text. Let's fix that.

With `Terminal` in focus, open the `Preferences`. Up at the top of the box, click on `Profiles` and pick a cute color scheme that speaks to you from the side menu, or get crazy and click that little `+` at the bottom of the menu and make your own. At the bottom of the side menu next to the `+` you'll see a button for   `Default` – click that after you've made your selection.

![terminal preferences window](http://i.imgur.com/Oaphc7L.png)

Beautiful! There's a whole world of color schemes out there that go beyond the defaults. We encourage you to seek them out when you want to spice things up!

## Code Editors

Three editors are primarily used here at The Texas Tribune – [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). We have no particular preference – try them both out! (You're welcome to use anything else, too.)

### Atom

[Download the installer](https://atom.io/) and install as normal.

#### Hook Atom into your terminal

Atom does this automatically on install. You should be able to type `atom <path>` in your terminal to open files and folders with Atom.

#### Suggested reading

Check out the [Atom Flight Manual](http://flight-manual.atom.io/) – it's a good overview on how Atom works.

### Sublime Text

[Download the installer](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and install as normal.

#### Hook Sublime Text into your terminal

If you want to be able to open Sublime Text from your Terminal, you'll need to [follow this guide](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/osx_command_line.html).

Now you can type `subl <path>` in your terminal and Sublime will open that file or folder.

### VS Code

[Download the installer](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install as normal.

#### Hook VS Code into your terminal on Mac

If you want to be able to open VS Code from your Terminal on your Mac, you'll need to [follow this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac).

Now you can type `code <path>` in your terminal and VS Code will open that file or folder.

## Installing Homebrew

Homebrew describes itself as "The missing package manager for MacOS." This means that it helps with the installation of many of the tools you'll use.

### Installation

First, we need to make sure your OS and Xcode is cool with Homebrew. Run this in your terminal:

```sh
xcode-select --install
```

[Go to Homebrew's site](http://brew.sh/), look for `Install Homebrew`, and grab the command there. Because it could potentially change, we won't be providing that command here, but it should start with something that looks like `ruby -e "$(curl...`.

It'll then ask for your computer's admin password – normally this isn't a good idea, but this will prevent you from ever having to run a command with `sudo`.

Next, run Homebrew's status check:

```sh
brew doctor
```

This will make sure everything is cool. If you get any warnings, we'll need to handle those before moving forward. Do what it asks – or grab someone else on the team for help – until `brew doctor` comes back clean.

Now we need to tell our computer where our cool new package manager and all of the packages live.

## Installing Python

The first Homebrew package we're going to install is Python. "But wait," you say, "my computer already has Python!"

You're right! But it's a good idea to not monkey around with your computer's installed software. There's some fragile stuff in there that your computer depends on to function, so we try our best not to disturb it. Plus it is much easier to troubleshoot if you know exactly where your version of Python lives.

Homebrew has [dedicated an entire document](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python) to how it works with Python. It's worth a quick read.

The Data Visuals team defaults to **Python 3**. If are in the rare situation where you still need **Python 2**, let someone know and we can help.

```sh
brew install python
pip install --upgrade setuptools pip wheel
```

### Pipenv for virtual environments

**NOTE:** This is only required for full-time staffers, although fellows are more than welcome to install if they want.

When you start working on group projects, it's important to make sure that everyone's working environment is as close to identical as possible. Virtual environments keep a Python project's installs in their own little boxes so there are no conflicts between versions being used in other projects, or those already installed on your computer.

Currently, the team uses [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) to create virtual environments. To install, run:

```sh
brew install pipenv
```

That's all you will need to do for now. You will use them more as you get up and running on projects that use them. A few include the [salaries app](https://github.com/texastribune/salaries.texastribune.org) and the [Republic API](https://github.com/texastribune/republic).


## Installing Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) makes is possible to build server-side apps using JavaScript. At the Tribune, we use it to run our project building tools.

Let's install it! We use [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage versions. Here's a [direct link to the install instructions](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script).

Now, if you run `nvm ls-remote`, you'll be able to see all the versions of Node.js that are available.

We currently base all of our projects on the current Long-term Support (LTS) version.

To install that, run the following:

```sh
nvm install lts/carbon
```

We also use [npx](https://github.com/npm/npx) with our kit that is used to create graphics, which will be explaining later. In the meantime, make sure it's installed by running:

```sh
npx
```

If that doesn't work, run:

```sh
npm install -g npx
```

## Installing git

> You'll need a [GitHub](http://github.com/) account and be a member of the Texas Tribune organization. Someone should help you get this set up – don't worry!

To get this started, install git:

```sh
brew install git
```

Now we need to set some defaults for the git client. First we need to your name for commits.

> This should not be your GitHub user account name. It's meant to be your real name – like Jenny Smith – but you are not required to do so. This name will be public and attached to every one of your commits. Feel free to use a pseudonym!

To set your name, run the following:

```sh
git config --global user.name "<your-name>"
```

Next we'll set your email. This needs to be an email account associated with your Github account. Like the name, this email will be publicly available and attached to each of your commits. If you don't know which emails are under your GitHub account, you can [check on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/emails).

```sh
git config --global user.email "<your-email>"
```

> Don't want your email public? GitHub can help with that. On the email settings page, there is a setting at the bottom labeled `Keep my email address private`. You can then use the proxy email GitHub provides.

Next we'll set up authentication. The Homebrew install of git adds a helper that allows it to use MacOS's built-in Keychain.

Run the following to tell git to use it:

```sh
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

We also need to tell git to use `https` for cloning.

```sh
git config --global hub.protocol https
```

For more information on git and GitHub, check out [this interactive tutorial](https://try.github.io/) or [this walk through](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to get started.

## Installing the data-visuals kit

Our team has a kit that is designed to provide you with a framework for creating graphics. Included is the basic page structure, files to put SCSS and javascript in, a simple workflow for working with Google spreadsheets and a way to test your project locally and deploy to a server.

Setting the kit up and creating your first graphic is documented in [its own readme](kit-setup.md). Fellows will definitely want to go through through that setup.

### Credentials

At this point, you will need several files added to the root directory on your computer, which will provide you with the credentials needed to run the kit and other team projects. They include:

* .tt_kit_google_client_secrets.json
* .aws/config
* .aws/credentials

For fellows and full-time employees, these are stored in 1Password, which you should have access to after you go through the onboarding process. The `tt_kit_google_client_secrets.json` info is in the `tt_kit_google_client_secrets` note. The aws files are stored in the `AWS credentials` note. Please don't share these on Slack or over email.

Once you've got these set up, you'll need one more, which you will generate with your Google account after you [create your first graphic](https://github.com/texastribune/data-visuals-guides/blob/master/kit-setup.md#creating-a-graphic). You should see a url pop up in your terminal, which will direct you to a Google Drive page that says `News Apps Graphics Kit wants to access your Google Account`. Hit `Allow` and the token file will be generated and put in your root.

This file is:

* .google_drive_fetch_token

Once you deploy your graphic, you will prompted to enter your account information. The file will automatically be generated on your computer once you're done.

## ai2html

We use Illustrator to create many of our graphics. A team password for the Adobe Creative Cloud is available in 1Password.

As part of our setup, we also use [ai2html](http://ai2html.org/) to convert Illustrator files to HTML to put on our site. To set this up, check out our [instructions on Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/3098728/buckets/80634/uploads/1035900039).

## Installing QGIS

Although not required, our team uses QGIS to run geographical analysis. This and other mapping tips are avaiable in [the geo-setup file](geo-setup.md).

## Installing Docker

**NOTE:** This is only required for full-time staffers

Docker is a tool for containerizing apps. We use it for deploys and database management. You'll need [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/).

## Installing PostgreSQL

**NOTE:** This is optional for fellows, depending on if they will be working on database projects during their fellowship. It can always be installed later if you're not sure.

Nearly all of our projects use [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) as their backend. Instead of installing it with Homebrew, we use [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/) instead.

Visit [http://postgresapp.com/](http://postgresapp.com/) and download the installer. After installing, run the app. You should get a pop up window and see a cute little elephant romping around in your menu bar in the top right. If you see the elephant, Postgres.app is live.


## Explorer credentials

Separate credentials are required for setting up our explorers. Instructions for these explorers are in a [separate readme](explorers-setup.md).

On your first day, you won't need to worry about setting them up.

# &#9733; Bonus Rounds! &#9733;

Below are some things you can set up that aren't necessary, but can be very useful.

## Show invisible files

Run this command in your terminal to show hidden files in Finder:

```sh
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
```

Next, you'll need to restart Finder for the change to take effect.

```sh
killall Finder
```

In the next Finder window you open, you'll start seeing hidden files!

## Hub

`hub` is an extension for git that adds extra functionality. [Read more about the perks](https://hub.github.com/).

To install, we'll use Homebrew:

```sh
brew install hub
```

Next, we'll need to alias `hub` to point to git in your `.bash_profile`. (Don't forget to `source`!)

```sh
alias git=hub
```

## Pyenv

Pyenv can help manage [python versions](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) on your computer. You can install with the following:

```sh
brew install pyenv
```

This is optional and depends on the setup on your machine.

You can also download the [Python Wrangler](http://littlecolumns.com/tools/python-wrangler/) to keep track of python versions on your computer.
