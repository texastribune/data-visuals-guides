# Set up our explorers on your computer

Here's a list up all the explorers and apps we maintain, along with links to setup instructions for each.

This assumes that everything in the [computer setup](computer-setup.md) section has been installed.

NOTE: If you are onboarding as a fellow or full-time developer, you DO NOT need to install any of these, unless prompted by your editor. This is mostly just an attempt to gather all these docs into one place.

## [Salaries](https://salaries.texastribune.org/)

The setup and update processes are documented on in its [Github repo](https://github.com/texastribune/state-salaries-draft).

## [Schools](https://schools.texastribune.org/)

The schools app is updated once a year, using new data from the government. We also update it yearly with new cohorts data. The code behind the app is located in this [Github repo](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole). The data is loaded separately in [this repo](https://github.com/texastribune/scuole-data/).

## [Republic API](https://republic.texastribune.org/api/v1/)

This is the API that powers our directory, as well election results. Basic setup information is located in it's [Github repo](https://github.com/texastribune/republic).


## [Campaign finance](https://github.com/texastribune/campaign-finance-viewer_)

We have an app for downloading campaign finance data from the state. The [readme](https://github.com/texastribune/campaign-finance-viewer/blob/master/README.md) has commands for setting it up on your machine.

## Elections

These [scripts will pull](https://github.com/texastribune/sos-collector) election results from the Secretary of State.
